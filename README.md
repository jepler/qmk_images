# Mirror of all imgur images in qmk\_firmware readmes

# Why?

In April 2023, imgur made ambiguous statements indicating that some old images, including "old, unused, and inactive content that is not tied to a user account", might be subject to removal.
Because I knew I had added an imgur image to a qmk\_firmware readme that was not tied to an imgur user account, I was concerned that this image might not be retained by imgur.
By extension, who knows how many images qmk refers to might not pass imgur's new bar for retention.
So, I wrote this script to download them all.
This repository holds that script, plus all the downloaded images.

If imgur actully does delete some of the images, these copies may prove useful.
